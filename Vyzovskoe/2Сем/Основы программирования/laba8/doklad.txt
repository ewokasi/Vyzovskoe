The equation of harmonic oscillations.
Spring pendulum. Connection of characteristics with initial conditions.
Kinematic characteristics of the oscillatory process (amplitude, phase, frequency).
Dynamics of harmonic oscillations.
Addition of two harmonic oscillations with aggregate frequencies, pulsating Subject of mechanics. mechanical movement. Spatio-temporal reference system. Material point.
Kinematics of motion of a material point. Basic concepts are radius-vector, displacement vector, average speed, average acceleration, fast speed, rotation speed.
Acceleration is normal, tangential full.
